# Document 1: Overall Development Progress & Project Status
---
* Project: The Brickcraft Restoration Project

* Current Status: Phase 2 - C++ Engine Patching & API Expansion
---

### I. Project Summary:
This project was initiated to explore the modding capabilities of the unreleased 2012 Brickcraft prototype. Through a multi-week effort, we have successfully moved beyond the initial limitations of the game's native Lua scripting API and have developed a stable, working C++ injection and patching framework.

---

### II. Major Accomplishments to Date:
* Complete Lua API Mapping: The entire server-side Lua API has been reverse-engineered and its hard limitations have been definitively documented.
* Discovery of Core Engine Components: Critical C++ classes and functions have been located within the server executable, including:
   - The CityGenerator and LegoWorldGenerator classes, responsible for world creation.
   - The TryPlaceBrick function, the key to block manipulation.
   - The use of the Bullet Physics Library, providing a known standard for how physics are handled.
   - Development of a Stable C++ Injection Tool: A functional C++ injector (BrickcraftInjector.exe) has been built and proven to work.
   - Development of a Stable C++ Patcher Stub: A patcher DLL (BrickcraftPatcher.dll) has been developed that can successfully hook into the live server process without causing instability. It currently has an empty payload, awaiting final implementation.
   - Creation of a Mod Manager GUI Prototype: A separate project (BrickcraftModManager) has been created, demonstrating a working GUI that can launch the server and trigger the injection process, laying the foundation for a user-friendly launcher.

### III. Current Project Goal:
The immediate and primary goal is to fully implement the C++ patcher payload. This involves solving the final hooking issue to enable our custom C++ functions to be called, which will in turn add the GetPosition, SetPosition, and SetBlock commands to the Lua API. Achieving this will mark the successful completion of Phase 2 and unlock true creative modding.
